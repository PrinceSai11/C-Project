# Maze Solver in C

- Reads a maze from a text file (`S` = Start, `E` = Exit, `#` = Wall, `.` = Path).  
- Uses DFS algorithm to find a valid path.  
- Prints the solved maze with the path marked (`*`).  
- Handles invalid or unsolvable mazes gracefully.  
- Also a Maze Generator is given which can generate maze upto 13X13.
- We can print the maze from maze generator into a text file and maze solver can read this file.
- maze solver can than print the solution of this maze or any maze given by user into a existing or new text file .
