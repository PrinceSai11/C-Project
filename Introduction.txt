Maze Solver
The maze solver is a program that finds a path from the start point to the end point inside a maze. The maze is shown as a grid with walls and paths. The solver moves step by step, avoids going in circles, and finally shows the correct way to reach the end. The solution can be marked inside the maze or written as a list of moves.

Maze Generator
The maze generator creates new mazes automatically. At first the maze is full of walls, then the program makes random paths. This way, every time you run it, you get a different maze that is fun and challenging to solve

Reading Maze from Files
The program can read a maze from a text file. In the file, # means wall, . means path, S means start, and E means end. The program reads the file line by line and builds the maze. This makes it easy to test with different maze designs.

Printing Output to Files
After solving the maze, the program can save the result in a separate file. The output file can show the maze with the path marked or just the list of moves. This helps you check solutions later or compare different runs
